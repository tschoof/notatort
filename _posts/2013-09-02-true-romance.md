## \#notatort CW 36
#True Romance \(1993\)

I came across this movie in an obituary of James Gandolfini, famous for his role as Tony Soprano. That obituary also mentioned that it was written by Quentin Tarantino, and I was intrigued.

We’re talking about a “romantic crime film” directed by Tony Scott and written by Tarantino, with a good sounding cast. I’m just going by the names here, but it also seems to have received critical acclaim. We’re going for it!
