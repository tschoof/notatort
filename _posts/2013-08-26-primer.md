# Primer \(2004\)

After last week’s roaring success, we’re sticking with science-fiction, but leave the 80s behind and go indie: Shane Carruth wrote, directed, edited and produced “Primer”, also acts in it.

Wikipedia says it’s “*about the accidental discovery of a means of time travel*”, and that Carruth “*chose not to simplify (the technical dialogue) for the sake of the audience*”. I haven’t seen it, but think it should be fun.

“Primer” was realised for $7.000, and people at the Sundance Film Festival liked it. You may have heard of Carruth’s latest movie, “Upstream Color”.
