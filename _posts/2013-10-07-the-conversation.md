# The Conversation \(1974\)

After *The Godfather*, Francis Ford Coppola was finally able to make this movie. Some consider it his best work. Gene Hackman is starring as a surveillance expert who is obsessed with his own privacy. [Insert some NSA joke here.]

*The Conversation* was nomitated for three Academy awards and won at Cannes. Let's listen in on this! (Hah!)
