# Special Event: Star Wars Despecialized

We're watching the *despecialized* editions of the *old* or, *original trilogy* of Star Wars! What's the despecialized edition, you ask? Well, George Lucas has altered the original movies by a lot, and many find in quite distasteful ways. The orignal prints are "lost", he claims.  
So fans went to it and put together all kinds of sources to get as close as possible to the original movies while increasing the picture quality. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHfLX_TMduY) explains it.

(we're throwing together a buffet of some sort, bring something!)
